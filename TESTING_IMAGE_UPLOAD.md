# Testing Image Upload Fix

## What Was Fixed

1. **Corrected URL format**: UploadThing CDN URLs use format `https://utfs.io/f/{key}`
2. **Added polling**: Waits for upload to complete before returning URL
3. **Better logging**: Console logs help debug any issues
4. **Error handling**: Better error messages if image fails to load

## How to Test

1. **Open your browser console** (F12 or Right-click → Inspect → Console)

2. **Try uploading an image:**
   - Click "+" button or Edit button on a project
   - Go to "Upload File" tab
   - Select an image file

3. **Check the console logs:**
   You should see:
   ```
   Presigned response: { data: [...] }
   Upload successful! Image URL: https://utfs.io/f/xxxxx
   Image loaded successfully: https://utfs.io/f/xxxxx
   ```

4. **If the image preview appears** - ✅ Success!

5. **If you see errors**, check:
   - `VITE_UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` is set in `.env.local`
   - The token is valid (from UploadThing dashboard)
   - Console shows the exact error message

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Failed to get upload URL"
**Solution:** Check your `VITE_UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` in `.env.local`

### Issue: "Image failed to load"
**Solution:** The URL format might be wrong. Check console for the actual URL being used.

### Issue: Upload succeeds but no preview
**Solution:** Check browser console - the image URL should appear. Try copying it and opening in a new tab to verify it's accessible.

## Debugging Steps

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try uploading an image
4. Share any error messages you see

## Expected Behavior

After upload:
1. File input shows selected filename
2. Console shows "Upload successful! Image URL: ..."
3. Preview appears below the tabs
4. Preview has a red X button to remove it
5. When you save, the project should show the uploaded image
